## Project: Basic Express Server 

### Author: Bryan O. Garduno Gonzalez

### Problem Domain  

Build a modular Express server with the primary feature of a `/person` route that expects a "name" property in the user's query string. If provided, it returns a JSON object `{ name: "name provided" }`. Without the name, a "500" error is raised. The server will include two middleware modules. logger.js will log the request method and path to the console, and validator.js will check the query string for a `name` property in the `/person` route. Tests should be added for server.js, logger.js, and validator.js.
